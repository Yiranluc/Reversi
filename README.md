# Reversi
Our Reversi is a web-based board game, played by two people. One is playing with the white pieces, while the other one is playing with the black pieces.

Here is what it shows when you enter the game. Once there is a second person waiting for playing the game, this person would be paired with you and your game would start. Then, just enjoy your game.
